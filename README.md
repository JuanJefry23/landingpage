# LANDING PAGE ‚úàÔ∏è üìÑ

This project was made as a test, it was a very interesting project cuz there are multiple languages applied on it, different sections, nice effects like "lightbox-hover" for the images in the cards, when the users click on them then it generates a zoom turning them into a gallery.

The form html when it is submitted calls to a function in Vanilla JavaScript where all the data from the inputs of the form are validated first of all, the mail input additionally is validated with "regular expression" which determines if the mail inputed is a valid email with an "@" and the ".domain". After all the things detailed before there are a connection through "Fetch API JS" to php, one is called "enviarCorreo.php" this one sends a mail to an email detailed in the code with all the information of the inputs-form , the other one is named "guardar.php" this one makes the connection with a MySql data base where is storaged all the info of the form.
